### Vehicle Design Concept
In order to have better steering so we design the Ackerman steering in vehicle. And use the servo motor to control the steering. We download Differential at the mover motor.

### Vehicle Component
Our vehicle uses four sensors, one servo motor, one DC motor, and one controller.

#### Compass Sensor
The Compass Sensor is used to detect the direction of the vehicle.

### Pixy2 Camera
Pixy2 is used to identify the position and size of the red and green obstacles on the field to dodge the block obstacles.

### Matrix Mini Controller
Our vehicle use the Matrix Mini Controller controller to control the motor and read the sensor value

### Uitrasound Sensor
Detect the distance between the fence and the vehicle to know whether the vehicle needs to turn.

### DC Motor
Drive the rear wheels of the car to control the forward and backward of the vehicle.

### Servo Motor
Control the Ackerman steering mechanism to make the vehicle turn.

## Vehicle Components Introduction
We use DuPont wire and RJ495 connector to connect the sensor to the motor and the controller.
